The study of public policy is intended to offer every citizen an
understanding of the various and vast roles played by the different
branches of the U.S. federal government as well as by state, county, and
local governments in various areas of contemporary American life.  It is
also a field that focuses on the priorities of American society as
portrayed in the public policy choices that elected representatives make
on the part of citizens and the size of different interest groups that
advocate on behalf of particular policy goals.  This course looks at the
process of making public policy from beginning to end and in a wide
array of particular policy areas that are of importance to contemporary
American society.  Moreover, because the process of public policymaking
is best explored by examining particular instances of public debate over
a wide array of specific policy areas, this course will adopt a case
study approach to explore particular topics. Unit 1 will introduce this
case study approach as well various actors involved in the making of
American public policy and the process of setting the public policy
agenda.  Unit 2 explores the process of public policy formulation be
examining a variety of case studies, including energy and fuel economy
policy.  Unit 3 examines the implementation of public policies once they
have been agreed upon, the allocating of funding to pay for these
projects through the budgetary process, and the evaluation of these
projects to determine their effectiveness in achieving the goals they
were established to advance.  Unit 4 explores various areas of American
economic policy, while Unit 5 looks at several topics of interest in the
field of national security policy.  Unit 6 examines various issues in
contemporary American public health policy, while Unit 7 explores the
public policy responses of the U.S. government to a number of
environmental concerns.  Unit 8 looks at several topics of interest
within the broader field of education policy, while Unit 9 focuses on
aspects of public policy that impact rural communities.  Unit 10
concludes this course by exploring several areas of ongoing debate
within American social policy, including immigration reform, civil
rights legislation, and the criminal justice system.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC431: Public Policy Process.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Levi Fox  
  
 **Primary Resources: ** This course is comprised of a range of
different free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use
of the following materials:

-   [Annenberg Learner](http://www.learner.org/index.html)
-   [Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Fundamentals of Public
    Policy](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-002j-fundamentals-of-public-policy-fall-2004/readings/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Although all of the units will allow you to gain a foundational
understanding of the public policy process, pay close attention to Unit
1, as it will lay the historical framework for future units.  You will
also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments listed above.  In order to “pass” this
course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your
score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you
do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **78.75**
**hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 14 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and
1.2 (a total of 9 hours) in week one; subunit 1.3 (a total of 5 hours)
on Monday and Tuesday night of week two, etc.
