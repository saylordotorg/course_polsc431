**Unit 1: Introducing Public Policy Actors and Agendas** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Public policies are tools of governments used satisfy certain wants and
needs of the citizenry that they cannot effectively satisfy individually
or that are better served through collective action.  In contemporary
American society, public policies are generally selected and adapted on
a case by case basis, and to study the process of public policymaking,
it is useful to explore a wide range of particular instances in which
polices are debated, created, enacted, paid for, and redesigned.  The
initial case studies help to summarize this policy process and to
outline the key concepts that underlie the making of public policy in
general in modern America.  While the areas in which government, through
public polices, has played a role in people’s lives have greatly
expanded in the last century, the ideological justification for these
polices goes back to the debates over ratification of the constitution
and what role government ought to play in American society, as shown in
the selection from* **The Federalist Papers***, while debates continue
today about what the larger society owes to its members.  These debates
inform the ideas and actions of policymakers.*  
    
 *Public policy in America is made by an array of actors and
institutions that each play a different role in the process of
policymaking.  Most public policies are made in Congress (as well as
state legislatures and city councils across the country) through the
normal legislative process that begins with congressional committees
debating the content and language of laws—often guided by lobbyists
advocating for particular polices on behalf of specific interest
groups.  After being crafted in committee, laws are sent to the full
chamber for consideration, and if approved, these legislative public
policies are debated again in the other house of Congress, after which a
conference committee will settle any differences between the policy
visions expressed in the versions of the bill.  The president will then
sign the bill and, through the vast bureaucracy of the executive branch,
will be responsible for carrying out these policies.  The role of the
president in the public policy process, who often spearheads a
legislative agenda through the use of the so-called “bully pulpit”
afforded him by the media, has expanded greatly in the last century, as
has the size of the federal bureaucracy that handles the day-to-day
administration of these policies. *  
    
 *The creation of public policies begins with setting the policy agenda,
which means selecting which issues are important enough for collective
public actions and deciding what approach seems best for dealing with
these concerns.  The process of setting the policy agenda includes a
wide array of interest groups, including voluntary associations, such as
the National Rifle Association (NRA); unions, such as the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT); and corporations, such as Microsoft—all of
whom may hire lobbyists to advocate to legislatures in favor of
particular policies.  The policy agenda may also be influenced by normal
political debates between members of different parties who attempt to
shape public opinion in favor of their party’s particular public policy
planks.  Each of these actors is engaged in any attempt to frame policy
problems in such a way that the wider public will support their
viewpoint and their goals.*
