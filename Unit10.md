**Unit 10: Social Policy** <span id="10"></span> 
*There many other areas of American public policy that prompt debate
among policymakers, including those dealing with topics in the larger
field of social policy, such as immigration, civil rights, and crime. 
The debate about immigration is often particularly heated during periods
of economic recession; however, since the 18th century, politicians and
citizens have been concerned with the impact of immigration on the
national character of America.  Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Act
of 1883, the U.S. government began to restrict immigration from certain
areas of the world, imposing quotas based on national origins in the
1920s and setting up the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the
1940s to register aliens living in America.  Since the 1960s, legal
immigration has increased from Latin America, Asia, and Africa thanks in
part to changes in federal policy, but illegal immigration has become an
increasingly visible problem, especially in certain areas of the
Southwest that make use of migrant laborers.  Public debate over
immigration reform has also brought up the issues of American companies
and citizens profiting off illegal immigrant labor and whether a border
fence might be the answer. *  
    
 *Concerns over immigration have also raised issues of civil rights and
civil liberties, as some argue that racial profiling in order to find
illegal aliens is ineffective and against the spirit of equality that
has become instituted in American law over the course of the last
century.  In the years after the Civil War, there were initial attempts
to bring about racial equality throughout the country; however, the last
quarter of the 19th century saw the development of legalized Jim Crow
segregation in northern and southern states.  During the first half of
the 20th century, as the nation debated the existence of civil liberties
during wartime, with socialists and others outside the political
mainstream slowly becoming allowed to express their views without facing
jail time, civil rights lagged behind with legal segregation being oft
reconfirmed until the 1950s.  While the civil rights movements of the
1960s brought about increased opportunities for minorities and women,
attempts to level the playing field through affirmative action policies
beginning in the 1970s have raised concerns over reverse discrimination
and thus remain hotly debated today.*  
    
 *Concerns over racial equality have also impacted debates surrounding
the criminal justice system in contemporary America, as accusations of
unfair sentencing practices and police brutality against minority groups
has forced a re-evaluation of many once commonly accepted aspects of
public policy as it relates to law enforcement.  The United States
imprisons a higher percentage of its population than any other advanced
industrial nation, and the prison-industrial complex provides jobs for
countless Americans but at a cost of millions of dollars a year to
taxpayers.  Significant questions over the costs of these jails have
inspired many to question the benefit to society of jailing nonviolent
drug offenders, while others argue that prison life should be even
harsher to discourage repeat recidivism.  Some reformers have even
proposed spending more money in order to better educate and rehabilitate
criminals in preparation for their re-entry into society, where former
inmates often struggle to find regular employment once released.  The
harsh realities faced by convicted felons during and after their time in
prison also serves as a reminder of the important role that defense
attorneys play in advocating for their clients, although the American
justice system values the rights of victims as much as those of the
accused.  Finding the balance among competing interests in courtrooms is
just one more way in which public policy seeks to best serve the
greatest number of citizens in the fairest way possible for all.*
