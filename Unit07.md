**Unit 7: Environmental Policy** <span id="7"></span> 
*Environmental policy has been politicized in recent decades, with
Democrats tending to be labeled as the “greener” of the two major
parties in the United States, but it was under Republican president
Theodore Roosevelt that the United States developed a national park
system and under another Republican, Richard Nixon, that the
Environmental Protection Agency was created.  Moreover, concern over the
fate of the environment is not new but stems back to the late 19th
century, when people first began to notice massive changes in the
ecosystem created by the disappearance of the buffalo and its
replacement by cattle. These changes, along with the spread of farming
settlements into arid regions of the western Great Plains during this
period, would help make possible the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.  It was
also in the 19th century that the Industrial Revolution first raised
concerns over pollution affecting the air, land, and water around
factories and urban centers.  Concerns over pollution have also impacted
policies surrounding the limited supply of fresh water that is necessary
to run commercial farms in otherwise drought-ridden areas and to allow
suburban style development in such places as Las Vegas and Phoenix.  The
inherent conflict between industrial progress and environmental
preservation is also raised by the phenomena of externalities, wherein
businesses will often pollute without restraint unless they are forced
through government regulations to pay the true costs of production,
which is more easily said than done.*  
    
 *Many environmental policies impact not just the United States but the
entire world, including those designed to protect endangered species
from the impact of human settlement and pollution.  At the same time,
the United States often finds itself in a difficult position in
relationship to the international community with regards to
environmental policy because of our reluctance to sign certain
international accords, such as the Kyoto Protocol, and because of
accusations of hypocrisy, especially by such rapidly developing nations
as Brazil, India, and China.  The argument of these countries is that
the United States was allowed to develop industry without regards to its
impact on the global environment, and America continues to draw far more
than its fair share of the world’s limited supply of natural resources;
thus, it should not be forced to slow its own development now.  This
argument is problematic from the broader perspective of global
sustainability because if these and other industrializing nations, which
together constitute half the world’s population, continue to develop
along much the same lines as the United States and Europe, then it may
become impossible to sustain modern lifestyles for all the world’s
people. *  
    
 *One specific area of concern for the future of the entire human race
is global warming, which refers to the overall increase in Earth’s
average temperature and a related rise in sea levels caused by the
melting of polar ice.  This issue was most famously raised by former
vice president Al Gore in his documentary* An Inconvenient Truth*, in
which he argued that a series of small steps is absolutely necessary in
order to prevent the continued rise in temperatures that cause a range
of problems from drought to flooding and which he argued was the result
of human activity.  Many believe that it is necessary to enact a series
of public policy measures in order to slow the process of global warming
and to adapt to warmer conditions, but others argue that this climate
change is a natural process.  Those policymakers and interest groups who
view global warming as a natural recurrent phenomenon point to
historical weather data to support their arguments, although they are
generally opposed by most meteorologists.  The debate over climate
change will no doubt continue and provides an excellent example of the
often complex relationships among scientific research, politicians, and
public policy that prevail in America.*
