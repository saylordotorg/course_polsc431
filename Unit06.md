**Unit 6: Public Health Policy** <span id="6"></span> 
*The debate over the U.S. government’s role in providing health care for
its citizens has become increasingly heated in recent years, with some
arguing that the country is behind other industrialized nations in not
providing universal medical care to all its citizens, while others argue
that federal attempts to mandate health care for all Americans are
reminiscent of socialism.  The U.S. government has long been responsible
for providing medical care directly through Veterans Administration
hospitals and with paying for the costs associated with health care for
the elderly and the poor through Medicare and Medicaid—entitlement
programs that are largely viewed as politically untouchable.  Still, the
rising costs of providing medical care have spurred increasing efforts
at reform despite the political consequences as well as increased
interests in studying ways to reduce costs through a variety of
preventative steps meant to decrease the usage of emergency rooms in
favor of clinics.  Another aspect of these debates centers on the
confidential relationship between patients and their doctors, who are
trusted to make medical decisions but who are sometimes proscribed by
government regulations.*  
    
 *One area in which the American government has sometimes run into
conflict with the medical establishment is in the area of drug policy,
which doctors have long campaigned to be seen as a primarily a medical
problem rather than a criminal issue.  The success of the American war
on drugs, begun in the 1970s but costing ever more every year without
seeming to reduce the number of addicts across the country, has been
increasingly debated by policymakers in recent years, as many have begun
to question the costs of existing drug policies against the seeming
success of more liberal drug policies practiced by various European
countries.  In the United States, the debate over the decriminalization
of drugs has largely focused on marijuana, which has become legal in
certain states as a treatment for medical problems if prescribed by a
doctor.  Some organizations campaign for outright legalization, while
others argue that the law as it currently stands makes it too easy for
criminals to take unfair advantage for their own ends.*  
    
 *Those who argue in favor of legalizing marijuana often point to the
fact that alcohol and cigarettes remain legal despite the health risks
involved with their usage.  Indeed, alcohol and cigarette smoking are
considered to be the two major preventable causes of illness and death
in America today; thus, many argue that those who engage in those types
of risky behaviors should have to pay more for their medical care and
ought to be restricted in the products they can buy.  This has also led
to an increasing focus on why some groups of Americans irrespective of
their personal habits seem to live longer than others and to debates
over the best way to provide hospice care and other services to those
who are dying.  Issues surrounding the end of life, such as whether a
patient should have the right to die and what measures should be take to
prolong a person’s life, have also brought about a new round of debate
on the relationships among medicine, ethics, and law.*
