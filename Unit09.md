**Unit 9: Public Policy in Rural Areas of America** <span
id="9"></span> 
*Delivering public services to rural areas of this country offers a
unique set of challenges, largely because the sparse population raises
the cost associated with serving each individual resident.  Basic
services ranging from school busing to postal carrying simply cost the
government more to supply in rural areas than they do in more densely
populated parts of the country, but these citizens deserve the same
access to public resources as their more urbanized neighbors.  This is
even more true in certain policy areas, such as education, where local
communities generally pay the majority of the costs because rural
communities tend to be among the poorest in the country, with Native
American reservations in South Dakota, Appalachian counties in West
Virginia, and former plantations of areas of Alabama regularly competing
for the title of the most impoverished area of the United States.  This
lack of economic resources makes it especially difficult for rural
communities to pay for such special services as in-class aides for
special needs student, nutrition programs, and prenatal care, which
limit the possibilities of rural residents.*  
    
 *One reason why rural areas have lagged behind much of the rest of the
country economically is because of the historical lack of industrial
development in these places, with clothing mills and paper producers in
North Carolina the most common types of factories found outside urban
America.  However, in the last several decades, a variety of
corporations, especially automobile companies, have relocated factories
to rural areas in search of big local tax breaks and cheaper
nonunionized labor, while high-tech industries in places such as Texas
have resulted in former farmland being turned into computer company
campuses.  While agriculture continues to constitute the economic
backbone of rural America, family farms that had been passed down from
one generation to another have increasingly been replaced by huge
corporate enterprises, resulting in an even smaller segment of America’s
workforce being actively employed as farmers.*  
    
 *With employment opportunities in rural areas limited, many residents
have sought to migrate to other parts of the country, providing an ever
increasing brain drain in places that can least afford to lose their
most capable young workers.  This has led to an increased focus on the
part of policymakers on encouraging economic development in rural areas,
which would permit the people who call those places home to pursue more
diverse educational and career opportunities than are currently
available.  The incredible rate of technological change that has taken
place over the last several decades has made it possible for rural areas
to have access to enormous online libraries and companies to relocate to
the countryside while remaining in communication with the rest of the
world through wireless high-speed Internet and cell phone networks. 
Only time will tell how rural communities will make use of these new
technologies to change and grow, but it seems certain that government
will play a role in this process through public policy.*
