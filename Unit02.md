**Unit 2: Public Policy Formulation** <span id="2"></span> 
*The study of how public policies are formulated explores the specifics
of putting together policies that will then be enacted.  The formulation
of policies involves debate among different interest groups representing
the public, political parties representing the institutions of
government, and the bureaucrats who are regarded as experts in their
field based on their experience carrying out and studying public
policies.  It is therefore important to understand the politics that go
into debates of specific policies and the various skill sets utilized by
policy analysts in assisting actors in formulating policy.  Of special
interest is the phenomena of “iron triangles,” in which congressional
committees charged with making policy, lobbyists whose job it is to
influence policy, and bureaucrats who administer policies all work
closely together with individuals—often moving from one group to another
and often making the crafting of policies an insular process in which
outside viewpoints are rarely voiced.  This process of different groups
coming together to debate and formulate specific policies can be seen
most clear through a series of case studies.*  
    
 *The questions of how America should approach the often linked issues
of energy and transportation policy are key to how the country will
prosper in the future.  With gas prices skyrocketing and dependence on
foreign oil being a continued drain on American industry, many
policymakers have proposed pushing for investment in various new forms
of green energy, such as wind and solar power, as a means of
jump-starting the economy.  In addition to the rising cost of fuel,
concerns over pollution have helped reinvigorate interest in hybrid
vehicles and public transportation, despite the constant drain on
resources that nearly all subway systems place on state and local
governments.  How policymakers choose to focus America’s resources in
the coming decades in order to answer these challenges will help
determine the nation’s future.*  
    
 *Exploring how Congress, interest groups, and bureaucrats work together
to formulate public health and environmental policies can also yield
valuable lessons about the process of public policy formulation in
contemporary America, such as with the debate over funding prescription
drugs for the rising Baby Boom generation of seniors.  International
organizations also often impact American public policy in areas that
impact the rest of the world, such as protecting dolphins, while the
United States may very well require the assistance of such organizations
in promoting sustainable population policies globally and creating a
healthy environment for all humanity.  Scientific researchers also help
shape the process of policy formulation, especially in certain areas,
such as vaccination, where expertise is especially important to good
policymaking.*
