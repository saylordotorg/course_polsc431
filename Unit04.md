**Unit 4: American Economic Policy** <span id="4"></span> 
*During times of economic strife, Americans tend to blame their elected
representatives—often voting against sitting presidents and incumbent
Congress members because they failed to manage the American economy
successfully in the eyes of the public.  This is especially ironic
because not only do individual politicians have little ability to impact
the overall economy, but one of the major areas of economic policy that
the government does have control over—monetary policy—is made not by
elected officials but by the appointed members of the Federal Reserve
System.  It is this independent government corporation, which was
created in the 1910s out of concerns that bankers such as J. P. Morgan
held too much power over the America economy, that sets the prime
interest rate and can influence the value of the dollar by manipulating
the money supply.  This degree of independent control over the economy
has raised concerns among some that such chairmen of the Federal Reserve
as Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, who are appointed to seven-year
terms in order to increase their political independence, actually
exercise too much influence.*  
    
 *This political independence enjoyed by the makers of monetary policy
is in stark contrast to the overtly political battles in the media and
on the floor of Congress between Democrats and Republicans over issues
of how much to tax the American public and how much to spend on
providing government services to citizens. These ongoing battles over
fiscal policy are as much ideological as they are economic, and they
stretch back to the 1790s, when the first political parties were formed
primarily over the issue of the size and scope of government.  Today,
many who argue against government involvement in poverty reduction and
job creation do so primarily because of a philosophical belief that such
activities ought not be the responsibility of the federal government,
while others believe that the government ought to provide even more
public services than it already does. These political battles over
economic policy can often become extremely heated and have even
threatened to shut down the government on more than one occasion.*  
    
 *Other areas of economic policy that are often very hotly debated
concern American trade and development policy—despite the fact that
politicians do not always have full control over these policy areas
either.  The debate over whether to adopt free trade practices or
protective tariffs has been ongoing in the United States since the early
19th century, with manufacturing interests often arguing that they
needed help to protect American jobs.  The growth of imports from places
such as China as well as the movement, especially since the 1970s, of
American manufacturing jobs overseas have rekindled this debate over
free trade and concerns over the growing trade deficit even as the
United States has joined an increasing number of international economic
organizations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the
World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.  Many of these groups
also engage in international economic development programs, although
they sometimes face criticism for taking too much control over the
economies of developing nations and have even inspired violent protests
against their policies. *
