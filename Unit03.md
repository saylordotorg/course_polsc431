**Unit 3: Policy Implementation, Budgeting, and Evaluation** <span
id="3"></span> 
*The final three aspects of the public policymaking cycle involve the
implementation, budgeting, and evaluation of policies.  Policy
implementation concerns the carrying out of policies once they have been
created—a function that is generally performed by the federal
bureaucracy but also falls to a number of agencies, institutions, and
even courts in some cases.  The choices of how public policies are
enacted and whether policies are enforced uniformly or selectively
directly impact the effectiveness of these policies; thus, legislators
often attempt to influence how policies are carried out by trying to
reform bureaucracy.  Traditional public administration in the United
States since the late 19th century, when civil service reform resulted
in the end of the so-called spoils system, has been largely apolitical
and focused on effective delivery of services to citizens but is often
criticized as bloated and inefficient—often leading to attempts to
streamline the federal workforce as a means of trying to cut public
spending without cutting public services.*  
    
 *The question of how to pay for the public policies that have been
implemented is especially important to Congress, state legislatures, and
local governments throughout the country that must pay for the services
that their citizens demand while keeping taxes at levels those same
citizens are able to afford.  The process of setting the budget also
indicates national priorities as it demonstrates which policies we see
as vitally important and which are negotiable depending on costs and
current conditions.  Budgeting also involves trade-offs—most easily
demonstrated through budget simulations—where each dollar cut in taxes
is one less to spend on new military technology and each dollar spent on
new military technology is one less to spend on public housing.  Another
option available to Congress that is not to state and local governments
is running a federal budget deficit, or spending more money than was
taken in through taxes, resulting in an ever larger debt while eliciting
heated debates throughout Congress and society.*  
    
 *Comprehensive public policy evaluation is a relatively
recent phenomenon that has largely grown out of attempts to improve on
policy delivery as well as a desire among some to undue long-standing
policies that they see as entrenched or which they disagree about for
fundamental political reasons.  There are various types of evaluations
that are carried out regularly, such as audits by internal and external
sources, as well as one-time attempts to determine the effectiveness of
policies over the short and long terms.  All these forms of evaluation
are meant to measure whether the costs of a particular policy are
justified by the benefits that it seems to provide for the public as
well as to determine which policies should be continued as they are,
which ought to be re-evaluated, and which should be terminated.  The
process of evaluation is also the beginning of the next cycle of
creating new public policies, as reports on the effectiveness of
existing public policies form another basis for policymakers to judge
what belongs on their next year’s agenda.  *
