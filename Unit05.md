**Unit 5: National Security Policy** <span id="5"></span> 
*Protecting the American public from foreign and domestic threats is
largely the responsibility of the president in his role as
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces and as well as through such
executive branch agencies as the Department of State, which is
responsible for the conduct of American diplomacy, and the Department of
Homeland Security, which is responsible for protecting the country
against terrorism and helping citizens in times of crisis created by
natural disasters, such as hurricanes.  The powers of the president to
take the country to war without congressional approval have been
challenged in recent decades, stemming from conflict over the Vietnam
War, which resulted in the War Powers Act of 1973.  However, through
such agencies as the CIA and NSA, the president has been able to conduct
covert actions—often without congressional knowledge—although sometimes
facing scrutiny, such as in the case of Ronald Reagan and the
Iran-Contra controversy in the mid-1980s.  In a post–Cold War world of
increasing foreign threats from such countries as Iran and North Korea,
it has been necessary for the American diplomatic core to re-evaluate
its mission, to train agents in Arabic instead of Russian, and to
develop a more flexible response that balances humanitarian, economic,
and geopolitical concerns.  The presence of the U.S. military in
continued conflicts overseas and the public revelations of abuses in
Iraq and Guantanamo Bay have brought about renewed scrutiny on members
of the military and rekindled a long-standing debate about military
ethics in wartime.*  
    
 *It has also brought about heated debates concerning the role of the
press to report on the actions of governments during wartime without
endangering the lives of American soldiers.  The need for national
security in the wake of 9/11 has inspired actions that range from
annoying airport searches to potentially constitutionally questionable
aspects of the Patriot Act, which was designed to allow easier
information sharing between government agencies in order to prevent
future terrorist attacks but a part of which also allowed the government
to view library records without a court order in some cases.  Still, the
realities of terrorism from foreign and domestic sources has been
reaffirmed in attacks since 2001 around the world as well as attempted
attacks on the United States in the years since 9/11.  It seems clear
that continued vigilance on the part of the government and the military
is necessary in order to protect the American people, although some
actions of these institutions have been challenged in recent years by
public revelations of governments secrets by groups such as Wikileaks,
who claim to be reporting on information that the mainstream press is
often ignoring because of their close relationship with politicians.  In
turn, the government claims that such groups threaten national security
and the lives of American citizens and soldiers; thus, this debate is
likely to continue.*  
    
 *Another debate that has grown since 9/11 and seems likely to continue
involves the role of the government in protecting its citizens from such
natural disasters as earthquakes and hurricanes as well as in disposing
of nuclear waste in a safe manner.  Critiques of the former Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) being folded into the new Department
of Homeland Security became especially heated in the wake of the
government’s failures to coordinate relief efforts in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.  The U.S. government has also faced
criticism for failing to create a comprehensive plan for permanently
disposing of nuclear waste and for allowing plants to run longer than
originally designed, as public concerns in the wake of Three Mile Island
have prevented the construction of new plants since the 1970s.  These
related concerns have multiplied in the wake of the Japanese nuclear
crisis, which grew out of a natural disaster and have forced a
re-evaluation of the U.S. government’s disaster preparations.*
