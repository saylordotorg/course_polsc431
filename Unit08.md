**Unit 8: Education Policy** <span id="8"></span> 
*One of the most frequently debated areas of American public policy in
recent decades has been education policy, which has traditionally been
made on the local and state levels, but in the wake of studies showing
that U.S. students lag behind their international peers, there have been
increasing calls for a national education policy.  There is a vast field
of literature devoted to studying how best to educate American students,
and a wide range of policy initiatives are regularly tested out in
schools across the country.  One major issue seems to be whether
students in the United States are learning the material they are
assigned at each grade level or are instead promoted for social reasons
despite having failed to grasp the knowledge needed to truly move
forward.  Another set of issues relate to the relationships between
communities and schools, the relative responsibilities of parents and
teachers in making sure that students are properly educated, and whether
public schools can serve all students or if magnet, charter, and private
schools should be publicly supported options for parents and students to
choose among.*  
    
 *Many who advocate for alternative schools point to a perceived lack of
accountability in public schools, where teacher tenure and
institutionalized practices make change difficult to institute.  Various
critiques of the tenure system, which makes it difficult for teachers
with several years of experience to be fired for performance issues,
continue to be hotly debated across the country.  Meanwhile, a desire to
hold teachers and schools more directly responsible led to the passage
of No Child Left Behind, which set up a system of high-stakes testing in
which all American students are required to pass a series of
multiple-choice exams to show that they have acquired the necessary
content knowledge to move up to the next level and eventually proceed to
college.  This has set up a flurry of debates between policymakers,
which seems likely to continue in the coming years, over such issues as
whether state tests are really equivalent to a national exam and whether
teachers are required by the law as it is currently written to “teach to
the test” to the detriment of focusing on the critical thinking skills
that students truly need to succeed in college. *  
    
 *Higher education policy has become an issue in recent years as the
federal government has begun to play an increasing role to help students
pay for college with students loans.  This has led to an interest in
keeping down college costs, which have historically tended to rise far
faster than the rate of inflation, and a renewed debate over whether a
college education is worth the investment, especially when many
professionally careers are more than ever becoming available only to
those who possess postgraduate degrees.  The desire to keep down costs
has led to an explosion in community college enrollment throughout the
country as well as an even greater number of partnerships between county
colleges, which traditionally tend to offer two-year and vocational
degrees, and universities, allowing students to obtain degrees closer to
home.  These schools have also attempted to increase enrollment through
online education programs, which provide an alternative to the private
online colleges that offer degrees of questionable reliability.  Indeed,
it seems that community colleges are increasingly coming to occupy even
more niches within the educational system for traditional and
nontraditional students, which will no doubt lead to an even greater
focus on the public policy decisions affecting these institutions.*
